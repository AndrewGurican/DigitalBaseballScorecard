Hello Baseball Fans! If you like to keep track of games, but you don't want to keep a big stack of papers and pens around, this app is for you.

You can now develop, save, load, and delete baseball scorecards that you can personally edit on your iPad without paper and pen.
First, click new scorecard on the main menu, then name it and confirm your scorecard name.
After that you can edit the team names, umpires, date, and time. 
After that you can edit all common hitting statistics for your team.
You can save it and come back to any scorecard at anytime by clicking save and going back to the menu and choosing load scorecard.
You can search for all your history of games and see what happened if you could not remember or go back to editing a prior scorecard.
You can do this by clicking load scorecard in the menu, search for it in the search bar, and click confirm load.
If you want to delete one, click delete scorecard, search, and click confirm delete.
